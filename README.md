# Bank Loan Report — Power BI Project

This project is a Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard built in Power BI to analyze loan applications, funded amounts, payments received, and overall loan quality. The report provides both high-level KPIs and detailed loan-level insights to support data-driven decision-making.

The solution is divided into three dashboards:

Summary Dashboard: Presents the main KPIs including total applications, funded amount, received payments, average interest rate, and debt-to-income ratio. It also compares Good Loans (Fully Paid / Current) vs Bad Loans (Charged Off) across applications, funding, and payments.

Overview Dashboard: Displays monthly trends for applications, funded, and received amounts. It includes distribution charts by loan purpose, state, and loan term, along with loan quality and loan status breakdowns for portfolio monitoring.

Details Dashboard: Provides a loan-level table with filters for year, state, loan purpose, loan status, and loan quality. This allows users to drill into specific records and explore data interactively.

Overall, this project demonstrates how Power BI can transform raw loan data into a structured, interactive, and insightful business intelligence report.
